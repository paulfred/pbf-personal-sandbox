Something that is easier for me to edit on my chromebook than vi.

I don't think it's possible to push directly from github, so I'd still need to push from EC2,
and the fact that each save creates a commit doesn't fit well with normal development.
So, it's an experiment that may not actually bear out as worthwhile.
